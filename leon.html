            <p>This data visualisation by Leon Phillips, depicts the energy consumed around the world. <br> It can be used to see how the world's energy consumption has changed over time by comparing <br> many different attributes such as: Country, Energy source type, and Year</p>

                        <br>
                        should first be used followed by the pan sliders to navigate to an ideal position

                        This interactive map shows the percentage of energy produced from 
                        <br>
                        'low carbon sources' for each country. Where a 'low carbon source' 
                        <br> 
                        is defined as a nuclear or renewable energy source.
                        <br>
                        It can be seen that the continents of Africa and Europe have drastically
                        <br>
                        increased their relative energy production from 'low carbon sources', while
                        <br>
                        continents such as Asia, Australia, and North America have failed to.

                          Here, the way in which each continet produces its energy is explored in 
                          more depth. The stacked bar chart displays the percentage energy consumed 
                          from each energy production type while the donut chart shows the same but 
                          for an entire world average. 
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          It is seen that despite current societies great understanding of fossil fuel 
                          emissions, it is still the main method of energy production aroudn the world.

                  Here, idioms are used to convey how energy production has 
                  changed between the years of 1985 and 2016. The butterfly 
                  chart is used to show a direct comparison between the two 
                  year intervals. The line chart shows more detailed information
                  including how the world's production has changed every year 
                  between these two time periods.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The value types of 'Percentage Share' and 'Total (terrawatt hours)'
                  describe very different information. Upon quick analysis of the 
                  'Percentage Share' data, it could easily be assumed that the energy 
                  output over these time periods stay fairly consistent. However, although 
                  this may be true relatively speaking, upon analysis of the 'Total (terrawatt hours)'
                  data, it can be seen that the World produces significantly more energy in 2016
                  compared to what it did in 1985. As such more fossil fuels are being emitted into 
                  the atmosphere, having a detrimental effect on the environment.

                Both of the idioms displayed here describe how GDP has an effect on both 
                <br>
                the total amount of energy consumed and how that energy is produced. 
                <br>
                The top scatter plot describing the relationship between a country's GDP
                <br>
                and total consumed energy is fitted with a linear trendline which is displayed 
                <br>
                using a red line mark. It is clearly seen that a very positive, directly 
                <br>
                proportional, relationship is established between the two attributes. 
                <br>
                This is further reiterated as the mean square error of the linear trendline 
                <br>
                was calculated to be only 0.89. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The bottom XY heatmap is used to describe how GDP effects how energy is produced.
                <br>
                It can be seen that in poorer countries, there is a very high and medium 
                <br>
                dependency on using oil and renewables as an energy source respectively. 
                <br>
                Further, nuclear, gas, and coal energy sources are not used at all. 
                <br>
                While in richer countries, a broad range of energy sources are used. With coal, 
                <br>
                gas, and renewable energy sources producing the vast majority of energy. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The definition for the wealth statuses for countries are such that their GDP is: 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class = status1> Very Poor: </span> <span class = status2>less than USD 1 billion</span>
