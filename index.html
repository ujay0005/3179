            <p>Global warming, a pressing concern of our time, refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average
                surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases like <span
                    id="co2">Carbon
                    Dioxide</span>,<span id="fgas"> Flourinated gases</span>,<span id="ch4"> Methane</span> and <span
                    id="nitrous">Nitrous Oxide</span>. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a gradual
                rise in
                temperature,
                melting polar ice caps, and disrupting ecosystems worldwide. Scientists widely agree that human
                activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, significantly contribute to this phenomenon.
                Addressing global warming requires international collaboration, sustainable practices, and the
                transition to renewable energy sources. It is crucial for individuals, communities, and nations to raise
                awareness, adopt eco-friendly lifestyles, and implement policies that mitigate the impact of climate
                change on our planet.

            <p id="box4t">Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are generated by various sectors. The energy sector, including
                power plants and
                heating, contributes significantly due to fossil fuel combustion. Agriculture produces methane and
                nitrous oxide, mainly from livestock and fertilizers. Additionally,
                deforestation and land-use changes release carbon dioxide.<br><br>The graph on the right shows the top 5
                and bottom 5 greenhouse gas emitters along with Austrlia,China and America for compasiron. Soloman Islan has
                the highest emission per capita likely due to their reliance on traditional, carbon-intensive activities such as
                slash-and-burn agriculture and deforestation. Meanwhile,Ghana has relatively greenhouse
                emissions due to its diverse and renewable energy sources, primarily hydroelectric power, coupled
                with a predominantly agricultural economy. International support for sustainable development and
                afforestation initiatives has further contributed to the country's comparatively small carbon footprint.

                rise due
                to ongoing global warming, the world will face dire consequences. Melting polar ice caps and glaciers
                will lead to rising sea levels, threatening coastal communities and low-lying islands. Extreme weather
                events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves will become more frequent and intense, causing
                widespread devastation and disrupting ecosystems. Agricultural productivity will decline, leading to
                food shortages and potential conflicts over resources. Biodiversity loss will accelerate as habitats
                disappear, endangering countless plant and animal species. Additionally, human health will be at risk
                due to heat-related illnesses and the spread of diseases in warmer regions. Urgent action is crucial to
                curb greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and adapt to the changes already
                underway to mitigate these alarming future scenarios.</p>

            <p> Figure to left shows the results of a survey conducted by. It highlights that more people are becoming
                increasily concerned about th effects of global warming. As the impact of global warming contuies to
                worsen more and more countries are trying to build a more sustaibly and greener future.<br>The Paris
                Agreement represents a significant global effort to mitigate climate change and foster international
                cooperation in the face of one of the most pressing challenges of our time.The Paris Agreement,
                established in 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is a crucial
                international treaty designed to combat climate change. Its primary goal is to limit global warming to
                well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with an aspirational target of limiting the
                increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Countries that are parties to the agreement commit to reducing
                greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to the impacts of climate change, and providing financial and
                technological support to developing nations for their climate-related efforts. </p>
